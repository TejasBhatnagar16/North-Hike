# North-Hike
A problem in which i had to find the best hike possible under given conditions. The solution is written in python and 
makes use of a sliding window to reduce the complexity of the code. It was checked with a maximum of 100,000 checkpoints 
and took 1.28 seconds to compute the result. 
To test the code download the data form the hike data file and give the path of the corresponding file to the solver funciton.
